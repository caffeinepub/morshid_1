# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Polish site-wide styling for navigation, buttons, cards, and section backgrounds while keeping all content, structure, and routes unchanged.

**Planned changes:**
- Update header navigation link styling so the active route link is highlighted in exactly #25D366 and all nav links show an underline on hover (no label/path changes).
- Standardize button styling site-wide so all buttons (including button-like links and the floating WhatsApp button) have rounded corners and a shadow-on-hover effect, without modifying any files under `frontend/src/components/ui`.
- Standardize card styling across pages so card-like elements use a white background, light shadow, rounded corners, and a colored top border that matches each card’s existing theme color (including non-green theme colors where already used).
- Adjust major section backgrounds across Home, For Farmers, and Contact to alternate using only white, #F5F5F5, and #E8F5E9.

**User-visible outcome:** Navigation clearly indicates the current page with WhatsApp green and underlines on hover; buttons and cards look consistent across the site; page sections have alternating backgrounds for improved visual variety, with no content or navigation changes.
