  "summary": "The diff implements wrapper components for standardized Button/Card usage and updates global/Tailwind color tokens, plus modifies the three pages. However, several requirements cannot be verified from the provided diff summary (header stickiness, floating WhatsApp visibility across routes, all-site link audit, and YouTube embed fixes). Additionally, the color-token changes appear to introduce/retain non-#25D366 green values, which conflicts with the strict “only #25D366 for any green UI color” requirement.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-15",
      "requirement": "Ensure every green UI color used anywhere on the site is exactly hex #25D366 (including variables/tokens), replacing any other green values.",
      "reason": "The diff defines additional green tokens/values besides #25D366 (e.g., dark green #1B5E20 and OKLCH values labeled as dark/secondary greens), which contradicts the requirement that no UI element uses any green other than #25D366.",

      "requirement": "Standardize button styling site-wide so all buttons share the same visual style (rounded corners and consistent padding/height across all pages).",
      "reason": "The wrapper enforces rounded corners (rounded-lg) but consistent padding/height is not centrally enforced; pages show ad-hoc padding/height classes (e.g., px-8 py-6 h-auto) which suggests per-instance differences rather than a site-wide standard.",
