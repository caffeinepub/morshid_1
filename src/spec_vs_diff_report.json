REQ-29 (alternating section backgrounds using exactly white/#F5F5F5/#E8F5E9 across all pages) is not directly evidenced in the provided (truncated) page diffs.",

      "requirement": "Adjust section background styling across all pages so major sections alternate between white, light gray (#F5F5F5), and light green (#E8F5E9) for visual variety.",
      "reason": "The visible portions of HomePage/ForFarmersPage show sections using bg-white (and hero uses an image), but the diff excerpts do not show the required alternation pattern nor the explicit use of #F5F5F5 and #E8F5E9. Because the files are truncated, this requirement cannot be confirmed as implemented from the provided evidence.",
